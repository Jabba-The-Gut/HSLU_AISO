    "In the knapsack problem, you need to pack a set of items, with given values and sizes (such as weights or volumes), into a container with a maximum capacity. If the total size of the items exceeds the capacity, you can't pack them all. In that case, the problem is to choose a subset of the items of maximum total value that will fit in the container. Subset sum is a variant of the knapsack problem where items have constant values. If the binary variant of the knapsack problem each item can be selected only once.\n",
